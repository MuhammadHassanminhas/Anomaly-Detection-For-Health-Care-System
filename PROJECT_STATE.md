## Current phase

**Phase 0 — Environment & access verification: EXITED (2026-07-15, product-owner declared).** All 8 steps complete, all 7 exit criteria cleanly met (criterion-4's `dbo.TimeLine` caveat resolved by re-run, no code change). Spec: `docs/phases/phase-00-environment-access.md`.

**Phase 1 — Schema intelligence is now CURRENT** (index pointer only — spec: `docs/phases/phase-01-schema-intelligence.md`). No step 1 work has started; per the stop-and-wait rule, the first step still needs its own explicit go-ahead before any code/commands begin.

## Last completed work (2026-07-15, criterion-4 re-run)

Product-owner direction: investigate whether `dbo.TimeLine`'s COUNT(*) timeout (exit criterion 4 caveat) could be resolved by query optimization, re-run, report back.
- Diagnosis (audited, read-only, catalog + existing view allowlist only — no new access): view definition and dependency graph pulled via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS`/`sys.sql_expression_dependencies`; `dbo.TimeLine` already uses `NOLOCK` hints on every underlying base table in its `OUTER APPLY` joins. Baseline `COUNT(*)` at a 120s timeout returned in 2.4 s (2,469,619 rows) — not a genuine slow-query problem.
- Reproducibility check: 3 consecutive runs at the standard 15 s timeout, all exact, ~2.3 s each, same count. Conclusion: the original timeout (2026-07-14/15) was a transient blip (load/lock contention at that moment), not a query defect — **no code or query change made**.
- Re-ran the official pipeline (`scripts/verify_env.ps1`) unchanged: fresh `artifacts/env-report.json`/`.md`, `python -m cdss.validate_report` → `VALID`. All 54 in-scope objects now `row_count_status: exact` — **0 indeterminate rows**, `dbo.TimeLine` = 2,469,619. Exit criterion 4's caveat is cleared by this run's evidence, not by a workaround.
- Audit trail: `artifacts/audit/source-audit-20260715.jsonl` grew 104 → 215 lines this run (statements = audit lines, no timeout to produce a gap).
- No `scripts/check.ps1` changes needed — no source touched, gate untouched (still 72 tests / mypy strict / ruff clean from step 8).

## Last completed work (2026-07-15, step 8)

Step 8 — environment report artifact:
- New modules (TDD, failing test first): `src/cdss/report.py` (assembles + schema-validates `EnvironmentReport` → JSON/Markdown), `src/cdss/validate_report.py` (`python -m cdss.validate_report <path>` gatekeeper CLI), `src/cdss/schemas/env-report.schema.json`. `src/cdss/verify_env.py` extended with `run_verification()` (orchestrates steps 4–7) and `determine_in_scope_objects()`. `scripts/verify_env.ps1` no longer a stub.
- Design gap found and fixed: `AuditedSourceConnection`'s allowlist was fixed at construction, but step 7 needs to read the objects step 5 discovers live. Added `AuditedSourceConnection.with_allowed_objects()` (new instance, additive, original untouched) — required for step 7 to run at all, so fixed in place rather than deferred.
- **Live run against `INDICI_BI_Full`:** `scripts/verify_env.ps1` exit 0. 2,368 surface objects (320 views, 2,048 tables); all 54 export names now `found_as_view` (D-001's exclusions mean 0 discrepancies remain); row stats for 54 in-scope objects — 53 exact, `dbo.TimeLine` indeterminate (COUNT exceeded 15 s, F6, matches 2026-07-14 finding); 11 watermark-less objects (was 12 of 56 pre-D-001), exact match to the deterministic recount already logged in `ARCHITECTURE.md`/`DECISIONS.md`.
- `artifacts/env-report.json` + `artifacts/env-report.md` written; `python -m cdss.validate_report artifacts/env-report.json` → `VALID`.
- Audit trail: `artifacts/audit/source-audit-20260715.jsonl`, 104 lines. **Caveat (exit criterion 4):** 105 statements were attempted (54 COUNT + 43 watermark + 5 version + 3 catalog); `dbo.TimeLine`'s timed-out `COUNT(*)` produced no audit line — `AuditedSourceConnection.execute_query()` only writes the audit event after a statement completes successfully, so a timeout is unaudited rather than logged-as-failed. This is pre-existing behavior from step 3 (already gated), not introduced by step 8; flagging rather than silently patching it, since it touches an already-approved component outside step 8's stated scope.
- Gate green throughout: 72 tests (was 56), mypy strict clean, ruff clean.

## Last completed work (2026-07-15, D-001)

D-001 resolved: `dbo.PracticeStats` and `AIFinanceAssistant.tblSalary` (base-table-only, no view equivalent) dropped from the CDSS scope by editing `schema_for_SQL_PROJ.txt` (56 → 54 entries). Source database untouched — no DDL/DML, nothing dropped in `INDICI_BI_Full`. Gate re-verified green (56 tests, mypy strict, ruff clean). See `DECISIONS.md` D-001 (now DECIDED) and D-010 (partially decided).

## Last completed work (2026-07-14)

Step 7 — row counts + watermark candidates (`src/cdss/rowstats.py`):
- Live run over all 56 in-scope objects in 85.8 s; 55/56 exact `COUNT(*)`; `dbo.TimeLine` indeterminate (view COUNT exceeded 15 s timeout — reported as indeterminate per F6, never guessed).
- 12 watermark-less objects confirmed live, matching the D-012 risk note exactly.
- Full evidence trail: `artifacts/audit/source-audit-20260714.jsonl` (119 statements).
- Gate green: 56 tests passing, mypy strict, ruff clean (`scripts/check.ps1` exit 0).

Earlier the same day: steps 1–6 (scaffolding; config loader; audited SQL-guard access layer; live version capture — SQL Server 2019 CU32 Developer Edition; surface enumeration — 2,368 visible objects, 320 views / 2,048 base tables, all selectable; D-001 reconciliation — 54/56 found as views, `dbo.PracticeStats` and `AIFinanceAssistant.tblSalary` found as base tables, 0 missing).

## Current branch

`main` (renamed from `master`) — all Phase 0 code + docs **committed** (`cdc0652`, 2026-07-15) and **pushed** to `origin` = `https://github.com/MuhammadHassanminhas/Anomaly-Detection-For-Health-Care-System`. **Repo is public**, not private — no `gh` CLI / GitHub MCP available on this machine to flip visibility; user explicitly confirmed pushing while public rather than waiting. Repo contains real infra details (source DB internal IP `192.168.0.9`, full schema/column names, connection config) — visibility change to private is manual, on github.com, Settings → General → Danger Zone. `echo` (0-byte stray file) and `.coverage` were deliberately excluded from the commit (`.coverage` now gitignored); `graphify-out/` also gitignored (tool cache, not project work). Doc restructure complete (2026-07-15): `CLAUDE.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` (reshaped into Diagrams/Components/APIs/Dependencies), `DECISIONS.md` (ADR-style, index table added), `SESSION.md` (format-reviewed) — all 5 of 5 files done. See `SESSION.md` → "Resume here".

## Current milestone

**Phase 0 exited (2026-07-15)**; Phase 1 (schema intelligence) is the new milestone target — spec already approved in Stage A, execution not yet started.

## Current blockers

| ID | Blocker | Blocks |
|----|---------|--------|
| — | Phase 1 step 1 explicit go-ahead — Phase 1 is CURRENT but no step has been authorized to start | Phase 1 execution |
| — | Repo visibility: currently public, user confirmed pushing anyway; still worth flipping to private manually when convenient | none (accepted) |

Non-blocking housekeeping: stray untracked file `echo` (0-byte, accidental) still sits in the repo root, deliberately excluded from git — safe to delete whenever, or leave.

## Next task

Phase 0 exited 2026-07-15 (product-owner declared, all 7 criteria clean). Phase 1 (schema intelligence) is CURRENT but not started — per Gated planning / stop-and-wait, the re-evaluation step and step 1 need their own explicit go-ahead before any code or commands begin. See `SESSION.md` → "Resume here" for full detail.
